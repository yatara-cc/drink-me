## Getting started

### Hardware

-   The base and case are “snap-fit”; you can open and close them by pushing or pulling vertically with care.
-   Make sure switch pins are completely straight before inserting them into the hotswap sockets, otherwise the pins may miss the holes and cause damage.
-   It is recommended to remove the case from the base/thumbrest and support the hotswap sockets with your finger or thumb while inserting switches.


### Firmware

Drink Me ships with [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/) firmware preinstalled. To customise your keymap, install and run the [latest version](https://github.com/the-via/releases) on your computer; when you plug in your Drink Me it will be recognised and you can edit the keymap in realtime.

You can also use the online [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/yatara/drink_me/LAYOUT) to create a custom firmware for your Drink Me. Alternatively download the [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) source where you will find [example code and keymaps for Drink Me](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/yatara/drink_me) that can be modified to use any of QMK's [extensive features](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/).


## Support

Buyers can access support by sending a message to the email address on the PayPal invoice.
